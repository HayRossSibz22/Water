# Water
Relaxing exploration game. Story and art driven. Character on boat discovers animals with musical skills and collects bandmates.

Testing styles and water. Started in Blender to test different boat designs, wave types, and lighting to get a feel for the game. I'm also creating my own assets, starting with a boat and guitar.

Worked with shaders to test water in Godot. While I liked the results, I decided to switch over to Unity to work with the Flatkit Asset.

The Flatkit asset comes with many options for stylizing both regular materials and water.

It came with a boyency script, but I added to the code so the player can move the boat.

There is velocity dampening happening, rotation speeds, and many variables that can be tweaked to get a better feeling.

Currently working on the player animation. This is the rigged up character with visible armature.

I plan on adding oars that the player uses to row.

Some concept art of a frog that will play the violin:
